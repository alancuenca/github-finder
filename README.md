Github Finder

In this app we are creating a simple app that uses Githubs api to search for users.

The goal of this app is to properly use a public api to display the data we want. The second goal is to properly use tailwind.css and daisy.ui to style our page. 

We are also learning how to use 'useContext' and 'useReducer' from 'react' to both limit prop drilling and cut down on the number of lines that would normally be taken up by if statements.
