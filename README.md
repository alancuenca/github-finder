Github Finder

In this app we are creating a simple app that uses Githubs api to search for users.

The goal of this app is to properly use a public api as well as use tailwind.css and daisy.ui. We are also learning how to use react's 'useContext' and 'useReducer' to both limit prop drilling and cutting down on number of lines that would normally be taken up by if statements.
